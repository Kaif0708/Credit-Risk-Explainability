# Credit Risk Explainability: Explainable AI for Loan Approval  

## Overview  
This repository provides an open-source implementation of the research paper:  
**"An Explainable AI Framework for Credit Evaluation and Analysis"** (*Applied Soft Computing Journal, 2024*).  
ðŸ“„ **Paper Link:** [Elsevier - Applied Soft Computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494624000814)

The project applies **Machine Learning (ML) and Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to improve transparency in **credit risk assessment and loan approval decisions**. Using **Random Forest, SHAP, LIME, and Partial Dependency Plots (PDP)**, it explains why a loan is approved or rejected, helping financial institutions and borrowers understand decision-making processes.  

## Features  
- Implements **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest** for credit risk evaluation.  
- Uses **LIME and SHAP** to provide both local and global explanations of model decisions.  
- **Partial Dependency Plots (PDP)** to visualize feature influence on predictions.  
- **Random Forest achieves 99.8% accuracy** in loan approval classification.  
- Open-source implementation with structured, modular, and well-documented code.

## Results
| Model            | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-----------------|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.980  | 0.980  | 0.980  | 0.980  |
| Decision Tree      | 0.997  | 0.996  | 0.995  | 0.997  |

### Explainability Results  
- **SHAP Explainer:** Provides both local and global explanations for feature importance.  
- **LIME Explainer:** Highlights feature contributions for individual predictions.  
- **PDP Plot:** Demonstrates the relationship between input features and loan approval decisions.
